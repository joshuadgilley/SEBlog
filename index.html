					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>My name is Joshua Gilley. I'm a Computer Science student at the College of Charleston and a
						research assistance for CIRDLES. I've also been working as a programmer for Advanced Technology International in Summerville.
						I love
						surfing in my free time and I've been married for almost two years. I've also got a little boy on the way!

					<h3>Reflections on FOSS</h3>
					<h6>The Cathedral and The Bazaar / Comparison</h6>
					<p> The name of this comes from the reflection on Linux that this article is bring forth. The idea that Linus Torvalds's creation is not cathedral-building but more of a babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches. In a cathdral, there is typically a single creator or architect with a certain vision that will be implement and it won't be affected by the concerns of others. This is opposition the Linux, being open-source, which is what the article is pointing out. The open-source nature of Linux, allows many visions to be brought into the forefront of what Linux is offering. This has many benefits anywhere from a large user-base because of the free nature of the open-source, there are a large number of "hackers" who get to openly test and protect the software that they are contributing too. "Linux was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective possible way."
					</p>
					<h6>Zulip, Free Code Camp, KeystoneJS</h6>
					<p> 
						<b>Zulip</b> combines the immediacy of real-tim chat with an email threading model. Very similar to Slack, it is a user-friendly approach to creating groups and threads of conversations for teams to better communicate. We chose this project because it has high test coverage due to the easy reference for testing strategies. Zulip was also created with Python, which my team is very familiar with and the number of python libraries make contributing easy and fast. This is also one of the most popular up and coming team chatting services. Zulip also has a tremendous contributors guide as well as over 1000 issues that can be potentially contributed to by my team and I.
					</p>
					<p> 
						<b>Free Code Camp</b> is an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. My team and I have all used Free Code Camp to help us learn more about programming, whether it be how to use a certain language or how to use data structures affectively. There seem to be a range of issues in the open source project from easy changes like documentation to more difficult changes.
					</p>
					<p> 
						<b>KeystoneJS</b> provides a standardized set of components that allow for fast and easy development of web applications that can be quickly developed, maintained, and extended. We considered this project because it has a step-bystep guide to running it successfully as well as being built with the MERN stack which is something we're all interested in working with. There are up-to-date contributions and plenty of issues to work with compared to many other projects.
