            <h3>Reflections on FOSS</h3>
            <h6>The Cathedral and The Bazaar / Comparison</h6>
            <p>
              The name of this comes from the reflection on Linux that this
              article is bring forth. The idea that Linus Torvalds's creation is
              not cathedral-building but more of a babbling bazaar of differing
              agendas and approaches. In a cathdral, there is typically a single
              creator or architect with a certain vision that will be implement
              and it won't be affected by the concerns of others. This is
              opposition the Linux, being open-source, which is what the article
              is pointing out. The open-source nature of Linux, allows many
              visions to be brought into the forefront of what Linux is
              offering. This has many benefits anywhere from a large user-base
              because of the free nature of the open-source, there are a large
              number of "hackers" who get to openly test and protect the
              software that they are contributing too. "Linux was treating his
              users as co-developers in the most effective possible way."

              approach to creating groups and threads of conversations for teams
              to better communicate. We chose this project because it has high
              test coverage due to the easy reference for testing strategies.
              Zulip was also created with Python, which my team is very familiar
              with and the number of python libraries make contributing easy and
              fast. This is also one of the most popular up and coming team
              chatting services. Zulip also has a tremendous contributors guide
              as well as over 1000 issues that can be potentially contributed to
              by my team and I.

                >AWS vs Openstack</a
              >
            </h4>
            <p>
              Many large companies such as Netflix and AOL are switching to
              cloud computing with AWS and getting rid of those large expensive
              data centers. AWS offers mostly any kind of process from storage,
              processing unit, big data, etc. The main sell for AWS is the
              scalability, horizontally and vertically, that they supply along
              with elasticity where you pay for what you use. This is the beauty
              of cloud computing, but Openstack offers an open source version of
              this. My initial question involves the physical component of
              Openstack. AWS provides these services because of their enormous
              availability zones across many regions around the globe. So how
              does Openstack accomplish a similar product without a large
              centralized data centers? Well the answer lies with the fact that
              there are data centers that house all of the AWS similar services,
              but they are fewer and far between. One of the most attractive
              aspects of AWS is that it provides large availability zones around
              the globe so when you host an application on a vm in one of these
              areas, you can have duplicates operating on other vm's in another
              part of the world and redirect traffic in the case of a disaster
              or even a case of an unhealthy instance. Openstack is a little
              more limited. For now, AWS seems to take the cake for many because
              it is easier to understand and use. Openstack is open source and
              great, but it still complicated to make all of the moving parts
              coexist. Also, Openstack lacks certain features such as no
              serverless framework, no in memory caching, and no application
              deployment with scripts. For now AWS is the best for longer tenure
              projects. However, Openstack's open source free license factor is
              going to be a better choice if it can catch up to the user
              friendly connection between services like AWS has.

              Containers are something we've started hearing more about in the
              world of software. They've been made famous by docker and
              orchestration engine Kubernetes. But what are containers and why
              are they used? Pre-containers, applications would be formed into
              monolithic architectures. Containers act as a solution, where
              these huge architecctures can be broken down into microservices.
              So instead of one large development team working on a monolithic
              structure all at once, teams can be broken down into smaller parts
              working on these microservices. In these containers we can
              establish dependencies, libraries and other configuration for the
              environments where our microservices live. This can be great for
              reducing complexity with a multi-platform deployment. But how do
              we manage all of these containers? That's where Kubernetes comes
              in. It provides the ability to manage these containers. It runs
              containers across clusters to enable features like autoscaling
              resources. Containers will play a big role in years to come as
              companies are moving towards agile methodologies.

            <h6>6.4</h6>
            <p>
              <b>Window Focus</b>
              The bug isn't so much a bug but a new feature that was encouraged
              by Risha Gupta on github. The issue is that you often click on a
              message view to bring it the browser window, etc into focus, and
              then type page-down or end or down-arrow to continue reading. But
              the compose box captures these key strokes. He then suggested what
              do people think of the following change: If you've just clicked a
              message, and haven't started typing, page down, end, down-arrow,
              etc still goes to the message view? This bug, I believe, hasn't
              been resolved because the admins for Zulip fealt the they already
              had something simillar similar to the up/down arrow keys and if we
              wanted to make a change to this it would need to follow the same
              code path as what was already implemented.
            </p>
            <h6>6.5</h6>

              <b>Circle CI</b>
              I made my account for Circle CI which zulip uses. CircleCI is a
              modern continuous integration and continuous delivery, CI/CD,
              platform. The CircleCI Enterprise solution is installable inside
              your private cloud or data center and is free to try for a limited
              time. CircleCI automates build, test, and deployment of software.

            <h6>6.6</h6>
            <p>
              <b>Bug fixes and reports</b>
              This article was great! I constantly am reporting bugs for my
              internship and sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing the best job
              explaining what it is and where it might be. Part of the CI/CD
              pipeline established with zulip requires your communication to be
              formatted a certain or it's not even acceptable as a push, down to
              the name of your commit. This is extrememly important in
              establlishing strict ways in which we communicate.
            </p>
            <h6>6.7</h6>
            <p>
              <b>Bug Triage</b>
              You can tell that part of the administration in Zulip devoted to
              bug traige. Instead of only tagging bugs in GitHub they will also
              add a "high priority" tag. This tagging system in github is a huge
              help for forming bug triage.

            <b>Diff</b>
            The linux command, diff, will detail the changes between different files. This can be extremely useful in the vein of version control but you can imagine many other use cases. When adding the -u tag, you get a unified format showing "---" for removals and "+++" for additions. You might see something similar to this when using GitHub. This is how the UI shows the changes to files. 
          </p>
          <h6>Mastering Agile</h6>
          <p>
            <b>Time-boxing</b>
            In the world of computing you hear and learn a lot. One of the hot topics that you hear of is Agile. Agile is a methodology for productivity while working on a project with a team. Time-boxing is an extremely useful tool for productivity. The idea is that you set a specific time frame for accomplishing a specific task. I've used this even for studying which is extremely affective in comparison to multitasking. It's easy to get overwhelmed by many tasks so when you break down a big problem into smaller ones you can set a specific to accomplish the task. It can make the tasks seem less daunting. This is an extremely useful strategy when managing a team.</p>

        <h3>Stupid or Solid?</h3>
        <p>
          This article about stupid or solid was a really interested read for the fact that I noticed some of the flaws in my own code. The tight coupling section was especially interesting. These design priciples are primarily concerning object oriented programming, where I notice the issue in creating ReactJS components. In the beginning I would write conglomerate JavaScript where a single component was responsible for 50 tasks. This causes your code to have tons of global state to maintain as well as unexpected side-effects. It is better to break down these complicated components into smaller ones where they each have a single task. Global state is smaller and easier to deal with, there is loose coupling and the code is much easier to follow. A smaller detail, but one that I notice myself doing was in the "Indescriptive Naming" section of Stupid. In the section it states that you shouldn't abbreviate your names. This is something I'm guilty of where I assume other developers will know what I mean but it is best not to assume this. Long names are better than abbreviated ones. For example, in my internship, there is another developer who spent months working on a feature tab on the software we're building. For months no one has used this feature which basically makes it a waste of time. This is only a part of the SCRUM or AGILE methodologies but a very important one for the reasons I've stated.

        <h3>Release early and often</h3>
        <p>
          Release early and often is a popular SCRUM technique for releasing versions of software quickly and often. The reason for this is to make sure that the feedback loop between developers and users/testers. This ensures that bugs or necessary fixes in general are addressed quickly. One of the major risks in building software, especially in the non-open source side is working on a project or feature for months only for users not to care. We spend time on software to solve problems that people want solved. We want users to want to use our software and to need every part of it one way or another. Again, this tight feedback loop allows users and testers to be in your ear as a developer through a new feature. This will help you avoid unnecessary additions or features which saves you time and money.

        <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
        <p>
          This section talks about domain class development. Simply put this is reminiscent of our many talks of code reuse. Domain classes, simply put, are classes designed for specific domain to be used in multiple projects to do or represent something common. One of the examples in the book involves the Person class in legacy code reuse cases where the Person class is common for many legacy systems. A Person class as a name, a birthday, etc. All of the classes have this in common but maybe they have different business requirements so the class will reflect this. However, we can avoid redundancy by using the domain model and implement code reuse.

        <p>
          In this chapter, the book covers database development. The chapter goes over concurrency control, database access, etc. Later on the chapter covers CRUD functions which are really important. CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. These are very important concepts when managing a database table. Whether you want to create a new entry or update an already existing entry, these CRUD functions basically cover all interactions you will have with a table. Therefore, it is a very important concept to understand.

          I found the section, 9.2, especially interesting. This section covers project evaluation and code release which can complicating or simple depending on the nature of the project. It's one thing to build a piece of software but there is much to consider when it comes to deploying. This can depend on if you are building code for a minimal release in which case you can put a minimal release out in the public for use and if there are issues this can be address. On the other hand if there is a large change for releasing code and it is consumed by a larger market you have to consider a bit more. Who are the potential clients? Which open source license should govern its distribution for reuse? How can we assess the maturity of this product as it evolves? As you can see, depending on the size and scope of who your software will be used by, you must consider the deployment process in more depth.
