							<p>It is an interesting question when thinking about the code of ethics software engineers
								are encouraged to learn. There are obvious consequences for trusting your private
								information with a person or group of people that are not well-equipt to protect it. A
								lack of certification or license could lead to you trusting them when perhaps you
								shouldn't have. While this type of formal regulatory body doesn't exist in the software
								engineering community, there are organizations like the Association for Computing
								Machinery, the IEEE Computer Society and others. These organizations help better
								regulate
								how software engineers are trained when gaining their education which is an efficient
								means in better making sure that the software engineers going out into the world are
								better equipt with a fundamental code of ethics they may not have gotten without these
								organizations.</p>

								An example of this would be using the most up to data encryption to store the passwords

								emails, etc. Maybe you're looking for keywords or some sort of that pattern that would
								signal a red flag where law enforcement should investigate further. The result may be
								less terror happening which is a success. However, what could also become a reality is
								the corruption of
								these systems of data collection for unrelated purposes that are not in the interest of

					<h3>HW2: Reflections on Software Engineering Practices</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> After reading No Silver Bullet, Cherry Picking, and the Google Code
						Repo there was a consistent
						topic being discussed among the articles. The topic seemed to reflect on the best practices,
						workflows, and common pitfalls of software engineering.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> Software engineering is not only growing
						in practice, but the tools surrounding it are constantly evolving at a point that the
						individuals in the profession can hardly keep track of the complexity. There are an infinite
						number of tools and an infinite number of ways to solve a single simple problem. In some cases
						maybe they’re following tried and true methodologies that help to make their code the best-case
						scenario, sure. However, I would go out on a limb to say that in the majority of cases, the
						best-case scenario is not the case. The relationship between development, management and other
						departments is key in how software is developed in the best way. But in some cases, the
						relationship itself can cause some of the turmoil in regard to the quality of product that is
						being put forth. Management has deadlines, budgets, and clients to communicate with where the
						considerations of the developers are at the mercy of the deadline. When this is the case, maybe
						the developer forgets to add a few comments describing what a function does or forgets to reuse
						a component from another project. They are over budget on a project and have to finish it by
						Friday, so it is what it is.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> Although there is no silver bullet, there are paths that we as
						engineers can take to better the world around us in regard to software, and we have excellent
						examples of these practices. Google, for example has a single repository containing billions of
						lines of code. This may sound overwhelming, however, the advantages pinpoint some of the
						concerns in the aforementioned paragraph. Through this single repository perpetuated with
						Clients in the Cloud and Piper, they have extensive code sharing and reuse. We as developers are
						trained to solve problems but we all have a different way of going about it and this can make it
						difficult to cross-reference the work of one another when we don’t understand the syntax of the
						latest JavaScript library, for instance. Google has created a one-stop-shop for their developers
						to refer, refactor and generate solutions to problems that have already been solved. This
						ecosystem helps push the world of software forward.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Software engineers should not base their
						work on gut feelings, rather they should use the scientific method. At times it can be difficult
						to write a concrete mathematical proof to prove that a function works. However, there are steps
						we can take, such as defining what the problem is and writing it down as a theory. After
						defining the theory, develop a hypothesis and move toward testing the idea for solving the
						problem.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">“The best way from being stuck in the cherry orchard is to have a
						merged and tested
						branch ready to go when it is time for your project to resynchronize with the head of the
						development tree.” Instilling simple best practice in the community of developers is the path
						forward
						in the world of software.</p>

					<h3>HW4: Reflections on software failures</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">After looking over the articles for this week's reading, it is clear
						that the common theme is that of the historical failures of software. From spacecraft accidents,
						to FBI Fiascos, there are clear indicators and pitfalls that we can identify in these articles
						so that we can avoid them. But before we get into the specific incidents, why do software
						projects fail? Well according to an article from entrepreneur.com, the reasons range from poor
						planning, to insufficient time to complete, to unclear requirements. After reviewing these, I
						personally can think of numerous examples of situations I've been in where poor planning, and
						unclear requirements have led to messy rushed code. I can think of situations where there were
						too many chefs in the kitchen, and the project lacked a clear sense of direction. Insufficient
						time for a project can lead to a disaster, where you are rushing a product with little care for
						the structure of course but also very little testing which isn't good. </p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The Therac-25 has become a standard case study in health informatics
						and software engineering. It very may well be one of the prime examples as to why N-version
						programming in cases of vital healthcare software has to be properly funded and thought out. The
						machine itself was never tested by the AECL until it was already established in the hospital.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Another example would be the CT brain perfusion scans that people were
						getting pre-2010. Individuals undergoing treatment were receiving extraordinary doses of
						radiation that were causing awful side effects. "These tests have really high doses, and there’s
						no system for figuring out who is getting them and why they are getting them.” This sounds like
						a rushed project with no system of administering radiation in the proper dose to a patient based
						on what they need. Poor testing, poor documentation, this has all of it.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">There is a consistent message across many of these articles where the
						accidents seem to be caused by a lack of information flow. In the case of the FBI Sentinel
						project, it was over budget and behind schedule so they were throwing the kitchen sink at the
						project trying to get it finished only to miscommunicate and have a tool out there where users
						are losing partially completed forms because their auto-save feature doesn’t work. Or in the
						case of the space crafts, “all accidents involved one engineering group not getting the
						information they need from another engineering group. </p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">All of this is do to poor communication which may be caused by poor
						management. It is important when working on software, where the results are life and death, that
						the team is tightly integrated. That all members of the project know the requirements of their
						“component” and that the flow of communication is fluid. Truly these articles point to weak
						management which is the point of failure for getting a project done correctly, on time, and on
						budget. </p>

								If the user has insufficient funds to fill their tank, the gas to slow to a stop at the
								point their account reaches $0.00.
							</p>
							<h5>Bank ATM</h5>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
								The user should enter a pin number to access their account.
							</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
								The user should specify if they would like to deposit/withdraw cash.

							<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
								The user should specify how much cash they would like to receive.

								An engineer might do this by describing the relationship between the function and
								non-functional requirements. For example, a non-functional requirement might be
								"Passwords shall never be viewable at the point of entry or at any other time." Well, an
								engineer might draw a simple t-chart lets say where the non-functional requirement has a
								list of function solutions that might satisfy the requirement. The function solution for
								the example given above would be to have the characters password being typed in by the
								user replace with a "*" instead of the actual character.

							</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
								2.) The user approaches the machine and inserts card -> the ATM requests the user's PIN
								number -> the user gives PIN number -> the ATM shows withdraw or deposit -> the user

							<h4>Chapter 4 & Readings</h4>
							<p>
								From the readings for the week, the common theme seemed to be the necessity and
								usefulness of meticulously establishing requirements while also conduction some
								Test-Driven Development. It is important to establish your function/non-functional
								requirements pre-development because if you haven't properly done this step, you could
								get half-way through development without considering a certain use case and have it
								break in production or worse. As mentioned in the magic number seven article, we have
								limited cognitive ability when it comes to thinking of all the potential requirements
								and use cases so it is important that we consider throughout the development process.

					<h3>HW6: Chapter 2</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">With an anti-lock braking system the first thing that comes to mind is
						safety. It is important that the requirements and analysis of what the system is and how it
						should work should be fully worked out before any implementation is considered. Therefore, a
						waterfall process model would be most appropriate.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">For the virtual reality system I would use an incremental process
						model. With virtual reality there are changes the creator of the system is going to want to make
						along the way. It could be that the implementation isn't what you expected it to be or whatever,
						a more agile form of development is most appropriate.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">For the university accounting system it is important to consider that
						this system has done before. You are going to be reusing components, perhaps that have already
						been written. You're going to go more of the waterfall route, where once you have established
						the requirements and libraries you seek to use, the implementation can be put together in one
						go.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The interactive travel planning system is dealing with some complex
						form of UI which makes it similar to the virtual reality system. There are changes that the
						developer is going to want to make throughout, not to mention possibly the client. An
						incremental approach is best for this.</p>

					<h3>HW8: Mythical Man Month</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">After reading MMM it was clear that the writing was aimed a specific
						situation where you want to get something done so you figure throwing as many bodies at the
						project will get it done faster. This however is a myth. Certain projects in software are going
						to take a fixed amount of time to finish no matter how many people are working on it. In fact,
						sometimes the more heads working on a project, the more often there is a conflict in creative
						control and it can take longer to complete. The goal of the book is to make software teams more
						efficient by having somewhat realistic expectations, having good communication and understanding
						limitations. The more manpower you add, the quicker a project will get done right?! Not always.
						This can work for simplistic tasks, but this is not the case with software which is oftentimes
						lead by deadlines and teams of close communication. </p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The key is understanding that software is sequential a lot like a
						pregnancy. No matter how many women you have trying to make a baby, it's still going to take 9
						months to produce. The author recommends a specific sequence of how to go about structuring a
						project where the majority of your time, 1/3 is spent actually planning. In fact, the minimal
						amount of time is spent writing the code which seems strange. The reasoning is because if you
						plan properly the amount of time it will take to write the code is minimal because you avoid
						having to backtrack from hitting a wall.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Communication is the main feature of this book, the more your
						developers are communicating in the onboarding processing the better. Brooks law is invoked a
						few times which states that adding manpower to a project can only make it later. The problem
						with extremely large teams is that if you have n number of people communicating that is n^2 -1
						number of potential lines of communication. Whereas if you have two people working there are
						only two directions the communication can go.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> An important aspect of the book seems to be about keeping teams
						small. Also during the onboarding process, get the developers up to speed quickly by introducing
						the technologies you use quickly and putting them is small teams. Also it isn't always the best
						to hire a highly experienced developer for many reasons. They may be more difficult to teach if
						they have set habits and ways they aren't comfortable getting away from whereas a junior
						developer can be a little more willing to be molded towards what you want out of a developer.
						Whether it be the general workflow or the tech stack that you use, a young inspired developer
						may be more willing to become your ideal developer on the team, with time dedicated to their
						development.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">All in all it was a very interesting read and I can see how books like
						these are important to read in regards to development operations because by keeping some of
						these pitfalls in the back of your mind, you can avoid the mistakes of just throwing bodies at a
						project which could result in a missed deadline, or loss of capital. </p>

					<h3>HW9: Chapter 8 and reflections on testing</h3>
					<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;">8.7</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Ernie as a forecaster for the local weather station in Anchorage,
						Alaska where it's very cold throughout most of the year. Ernie sits down to access the system
						with his login and password through the weather station. He seeks to check the forecast for the
						next two weeks by accessing the future forecast page. He first checks the date at the top of the
						page to make sure that he isn't looking a previous weeks weather forecast, but instead upcoming
						forecasts. Understanding that the probability for that forecast may change throughout the week,
						Ernie has a new report of weather data sent to be printed every few hours or so. Given that new
						report he maneuvers over to the predicted forecast page to compare how accurate the infomation
						for future forecasts are. He then updates the social media page with information about the
						future forecasts. When finished, he then logs off and prepares for his 10 minute segment.
					</p>
					<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;">8.10</h4>

					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">There is scale for how unethical it is to only test to the limits of
						the budget based on what the application is. Maybe it's an application for counting the number
						of water you drank in a day and there are a few bugs from a lack of testing that can be fixed in
						future updates with more money being allocated to the update. This can be a normal part of the
						development process. However, if prefection is essential for a piece of software where it must
						be tested exhaustively, such as anyting in the medical sector, you can't stop testing because of
						a budget. If this is the case then you shouldn't be shipping out the product until more funding
						is recieved, or more of you budget needs to be allocated to testing. All-in-all it is unethical
						to bring testing to a hault based on the budget alone. </p>
					<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;">Reflections on readings</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">One of the takeaways from the reading is that modularity does not only
						apply to the system itself but also to the tests. Tests when broken down into smaller components
						can be more easily understood the better prevent bugs. Testing should be organized into these
						components. Also it was pointed out that there are major differences between debugging and
						testing. Debugging is the process of fixing the bug where as testing is the process of finding
						bugs and errors. Debugging is but a subprocess of the testing process. The testing plan and
						process can be developed by "outsiders" of the project whereas debugging is more internal and
						has to be done by and internal source. This is why it is important to have a strong testing
						design with multiple inputs of not only the developers and individuals hands on with the system
						itself, but also people like Ernie who are going to interact with the system everyday. This
						user-input is valuable to the overall testing process. A strong test plan and design makes for
						easier modularity for debugging and also less bugs in the first place.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">A software contractor is paid to develop the system, but does not have
						the right to reuse the developed code because it is owned by the contractor. Even though he/she
						developed the the code they do not have the right to reuse that component. If they would like to
						obtain the ability to do so they can negotiate that out with the individual or group who
						purchased the system in the first place. A contractor could even work out a deal with a client
						where the ability to reuse code involved in the system they developed for you gives you a
						discount. Something like this where reuse is negotiating. But no, you as the developer are not
						always the "owner" of the system you built.

						<b>Fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerabilities: </b>
						These include coding errors which are usually pretty cheap to fix, design errors which are more
						expensive and involve rewriting many programs. Requirements errors are the most expensive
						because of the potential redesign to the entire system.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						<b>Environmental adaptation to adapt the software to new platforms and environments:</b>
						This is required when something changes in regards to the environment, say the hardware or the
						operating system. Application systems may have to change in order to cope with the environmental
						changes.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						<b>Functionality addition to add new features and to support new requirements: </b>
						This is necessary when requirements change in response to business or organizational changes.
						The scale of changes to software can be much larger that other types of maintenance.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						There are instances such as with the term "Adaptive Maintenance" where the meaning describes
						adapting to a new environment but it can also mean adapting the software to new requirements.
						"Perfective maintenance" has the same sort of semantic issues.
					</p>
					<h4 style="text-indent: 40px;">9.10</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						Sofware engineers have a proessional responsibility to develop code that is easily maintained
						for many reason. The first is to make life easy for the organization or group of developers you
						are working with. In any case where a developer is no longer working on a project, he/she should
						consider making life easier on the individuals who are set to work on it either. In some cases,
						months of work can go in the trash because it is poorly documented and poorly written. This is
						because the next group doesn't feel like dealing with all of the falacies that could potentially
						be lurking in the shadows of messy code. Writing code responsibly so that it is easy to maintain
						should be the base line for any developer.

						machine goes down the only person dealing with that issue is usally the one with that device.
						When a server goes down, thousands can be left without that service. So availability can be an
						issue when switching from Desktop to Web.</p>
					<h4>Financial</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As long as you dont have millions of visitors per day you can usually
						get away with a small machine handle a large nuber of visitors. ISP's could rent out a maching
						for around 1,000$ a month and this configuration can workout fine. However, if you're dealing
						with larger traffic you have to consider what it will cost to implement the service.</p>
					<h4>Security</h4>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Obviously, security is an issue for any web service dealing with
						sensative information. Vulnerabilities to a web service can be present in many places like the
						operating system, data base, and the server. This is something to consider when making the
						switch. </p>

						would make this easy to understand for any future developers that are going to work on it. Just

					<h3>HW20: Team Progress II</h3>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						We faced several hurdles during this phase of the project. Obviously the most glaring was the
						need to completely refactor our code after realizing we were doing some things incorrectly.
						However, we would have needed to refactor a bit anyway to enable our script to handle multiple
						drivers. Before the refactor, our program had some info hard coded that while functional,
						would’ve had to have been duplicated and adjusted should the user want to add additional test
						cases. Now, our program has nothing about any test case hard coded anywhere, and our script can
						handle as many drivers/test cases as the user could write without any adjustment. This was just
						one of the hurdles we faced while tackling this deliverable though.
						One of our other issues was simply finding methods we could use to test. Moodle is a somewhat
						large project with some very complex functions, and it took us several hours of looking to find
						enough methods to use. We had a lot of success finding methods in a php file called weblib.php,
						but we thought it to be a cheap move to use that class more than necessary. Then again, many
						methods in weblib.php had to do with converting html elements into entities which made for
						tricky testing, so we ultimately decided to move on. This was likely for the best as the methods
						we found work very well for our purposes.
						The final issue we had was trying to figure out how to call our script from the correct place
						and having it run. This turned out to be a simple fix. Now we have a bash script in the scripts
						folder that runs all of the scripts in that folder, including out runAllTests script. Having
						remedied that final error, we feel that we have adequately completed deliverable 4 and we are
						confident in our ability to accomplish everything for deliverable 5.
					</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
						This deliverable was particularly difficult for the team. We thought that most of the work would
						be done after deliverable 3, that we would just need to make some minor adjustments to the
						script and the driver and then we could easily write the other 4 drivers and 20 test cases. That
						clearly was not the case as we had to not only refactor our code for 2 reasons, but also that we
						had to spend hours on a scavenger hunt for a method we might be able to test. It took a lot of
						work and patience to get everything done, yet we believe we managed to do so with some elegance
						and some class. We are happy with our project considering that at this point we believe we’ve
						done everything we need to and it’s working as specified. Nonetheless, we’ve become weary in our
						experiences with open source projects, and we are fully prepared for whatever curveballs
						deliverable 5 has in store for us.

					<h3>Initialization</h3>
					<p>In contributing to Squid Ink, my first steps were to fork the repository and get it running. The
						documentation on the repo for squid ink is plentiful but there were some workarounds that I had
						to figure out in setting up my database. After establishing my cluster in MongoDB Atlas, I need
						to figure out how to actually post a new user through the /api/users/login url. So after firing
						up the server on localhost:5000 and the client on localhost:3000 I used postman to post a new
						user to the database at localhost:5000/api/users/register as shown in the images below.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em" src="images/registerSchema.jpg"
							alt="registerSchema" /></span>
					<p>As you can see in the lower half, my POST was well recieved. With a new hashed password and an
						ObjectID, the new user "Josh Gilley" has been stored in the database show below.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em" src="images/newUserPost.jpg"
							alt="newUserPost" /></span>
					<p>After establishing that my connection between the server and database I needed to make sure that
						I could successfully login using localhost:5000/api/users/login. After doing a POST of name,
						email, and password the response was a successful login with a 200 header as well as a Bearer
						token shown below!</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em" src="images/successfulLogin.jpg"
							alt="successfulLogin" /></span>
					<p>And there we have it! I've got the tool running on my machine and I've successfully connected to
						database. Additionally, I learned that if you don't manually shut down the server and then try
						the run the tool again you can run into issues being that the current structure is looking for a
						specific port and if that port is already in use, you'll have issues. So I learned how to shut
						down that port at the command line. Using the command "sudo kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:5000`", the
						process id is locating for that specific port and then the kill command shuts it down! This can
						be useful if you left a port open and you want to quickly shut it down.</p>
					<p>Next steps are to understand how Docker is being used in the project so we can better establish
						the bigger picture of what is to be accomplished with Squid Ink.</p>

					<h3>Upload Files Addition</h3>

					<p>The big picture for the "Upload Files" Tab is to be able to upload files to the database. The
						addition I was hoping to make was to actually display the files that you have selected in the UI
						and to make the Remove button functional in removing particular files from the UI. To accomplish
						this I needed to go into the Upload.js component and actually establish a state variable to keep
						track of the selected file's name, size, and obviously its index in the array.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em"
							src="images/uploadFilesAdd/establishFileInfo.jpg" alt="registerSchema" /></span>
					<p>After creating this array I created a map for file in the fileInfo array to display that info on
						the screen. After displaying the file's name and size we needed to add functionality to the
						remove button which actually removes the file from the array and through that change of state
						removes it from the UI. This is shown in the screenshot below where you see an addition to the
						onClick function in the remove button that allows this functionality.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em"
							src="images/uploadFilesAdd/mapCreate.jpg" alt="newUserPost" /></span>
					<p>Awesome! Everythings working. Now to show it in the browser. Shown in the screenshot below are a
						sequence of added files shown on the screen. There are some necessary styling fixes to be made
						along with some clarification as to whether or not we should upload a cluster of "added" files
						all at once or one by one like they are currently. Also if the remove button should not only
						remove the files from the UI but also from the database or if this will be a function of the
						"See My Files" tab.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em"
							src="images/uploadFilesAdd/uploadsShown.jpg" alt="successfulLogin" /></span>
					<p>Finally, we've also got the remove button working which is shown below. I removed one of the
						items from the files that I previously added.</p>
					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em"
							src="images/uploadFilesAdd/uploadsRemoved.jpg" alt="successfulLogin" /></span>
					<p>I'm still back and forth with the creator of this tool to continue to work out the situation with
						Docker. On top of that, next steps are to work on the "See My Files" section to actually display
						the files on the screen that are currently in the database. Also, we want to connect the
						database ObjectID of the user/password to the specific ObjectID of the files in order to create
						a connection between user and their files.</p>

					<h3>Struggling with Docker & REST API</h3>

					<p>This past week was one of my more difficult experiences. Richard and I work throughout the week
						trying to understand how we could rethink the dockerization of Squid Ink, or if we could fix the
						error that was happening when trying to compose. Since we could not figure out how to get rid of
						this error, we established that since the dockerization of the app is important to establish
						specific dependencies within certain containers, we can just worry about redockerizing later
						once we solve some more of the hard issues with the web service. </p>

					<p>What seems to be more import is coming up with a way to save the files to the database, but then
						being able to access
						the files in the browser under the "see my files" tab. This is something that is done all the
						time
						using a REST API. The problem is that we are entering an infrastructure that was built before we
						were involved, so we are just getting acquainted with the project. The structure for the REST
						API
						actually exists so much as the POSTs go. We can use Postman to see that this is actually the
						case and it is working appropriately. However, when we try to run a GET on the /files page, we
						run into a particularly tricky error: "this.db.collection is not a function". Richard and I did
						extensive research trying to discover the cause of the bug, from changing the version 3.0 of
						MongoDB back to 2.2.33 to deleting and re-installing MongoDB entirely. We are now looking at the
						code
						and thinking that the issue has something to do with the line "storage = gfs storage in the
						server/api/ user.js component because that seems to be the db.collections issue is occuring.</p>

					<p>Basically, we are jumping into the project at a point where the previous deveoper was having a
						hard time figuring it out as well. This may end up being a restucturing of how we actually store
						and interact with the database so that we don't run into this issue. We may have to work
						backwards before we can work forwards on this.</p>

					<p>Where the problem is now, I created a stack overflow question hoping to address the issue soon.
						But if I don't here back soon, we may move on to rebuild some of the posting and getting of the
						files, even though it is partially working.</p>

					<h3>Success! See My Files Now Functional</h3>

					<p>This past week we had some good new happen. We got over the hill of the collection.db error and
						we were able to rework it. By removing the mongoose.connect, and instituting the
						MongoClient.connect we are able to pass in the client as an argument and call client.db which
						works for the newer version of MongoDB. The error we were running into before was because the
						code was operatable for an older version. </p>

					<p>Now that we got that running, the second step was to establish the ObjectID for each user, in
						every file that they post. So if Bud's ID is "123", then "123" will be stored in metadata for
						each file. We were able to implement this so now with we do the fetch to api/users/files we get
						a display of json formatted files, relevant to the user that is connected to them.</p>

					<p>All in all, we've got See My Files working and now the entire thing is redesigned with Material
						UI.</p>

					<p>Next steps are going to be accessing the list of files in "See My Files" when you are in the
						Squid container and you want to "Choose Files". </p>

					<h3>Dockerized Servlet, Feature Flow, and Cirdles Web UI</h3>

					<p>This past week was spent figuring out how to developer a small servlet that saves a file to a
						folder. This servlet is displayed in the browser using tomcat and lives inside of a docker
						container where you can save files. Along with this task was to begin to figure out how the
						other Cirdles projects are implemented in Cirdles Web UI. While I worked on the dockerized
						tomcat servlet, Richard spent time understanding how we can go ahead and connect the landing
						page of Squid Ink into Cirdles Web UI, which is the end goal. </p>

					<p>Displayed below is a diagram of what has been accomplished and what the next steps are and how
						they work together.</p>

					<span class=""><img style="border: grey solid 2px; width: 50em" src="images/featureFlow.png"
							alt="featureFlow" /></span>

					<p>The tomcat container where the servlet lives is a placeholder for what will be Squid Ink. All of
						the different core algorithms and interactive UI will exist within this container. This is a
						large project, but we have to start somewhere. One of the features of this container is the
						ability to save and use files within a container. So the first step is to create this
						functionality with our simple file upload. We accomplished this through first creating our
						simple file uploader servlet and to export this project with and index.html as a WAR file. Next
						we wanted to use the dockerized Tomcat container to create an endpoint for the WAR file. Now
						when you go to the specific endpoint from the Tomcat server, you have access to the file
						uploader. Now we want to give a new path to the servlet that represents a directory inside the
						container for the files to be saved. We had success with this, but not only that, we started up
						the file uploader on 80:8080 and 81:8080 which were two separate containers running on two
						separate ports. We saved different files in the different containers and bashed into the
						containers to show that those files were indeed in there. This proves that we can have mutually
						exlusive sessions happening between users, where every user can have their own unique port to
						live on while interacting with Squid Ink. </p>

					<p>With Richard's implementation of Squid Ink boilerplate in the Cirdles Web UI and my dockerized
						Tomcat servlet, we have the pieces to this finished web service. Now I want to use the dockerize
						Tomcat servlet to fire up two separate containers on two seperate ports, upload and save files
						in the separate containers to show that multiple containers can run. This is another implemental
						part of the service we are trying to survive. </p>

					<h3>Integration to Cirdles Web UI</h3>

					<p>A lot of progress has been made since the last post. The architecture mentioned in the previous
						post has been fruitful. After creating a simple java servlet acting as a placeholder for Squid
						Ink, we were able to dockerize the servlet into a container that has java 1.8 and tomcat 9. Not
						only this, but being that the servlet we created was a file uploader, we were able to prove that
						we can spawn to containers on two separate ports and save different files inside of the
						container. This was a major step. </p>

					<p>After getting this to fully operate, we had to fully reconfigure the mongodb database to a more
						local mysql database. After getting this to work, we started to transfer our UI directly into
						the Cirdles Web UI, being that that is the end goal. Now that we've got that, we wanted to fire
						up the container containing the servlet file uploader upon logging into your squid ink. We
						actually have accomplished this as well. The past few weeks were very productive.</p>
